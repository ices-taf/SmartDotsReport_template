3. DATA SPECIFIC INFORMATION
The SmartDots platform facilitates image based age reading and maturity staging events for calibration and training purposes. A set of software tools supports the organiser in managing all images and data of the event, and the participants in annotating their age or maturity determinations during the event. All registered data are available in the connected reporting environment.
Downloadable ZIP bundles come in two forms; the requested data file in CSV format with all data included in one file, where rows are used as record separators and commas as field separators plus the data disclaimer and/or an email with event report and summary report in .doc format to be edited plus the log file. 
The users are urged to treat the data with caution. If the user has any queries on the validity of the data or the conclusions to be drawn they should contact the event organiser. For direct feedback and or issues related to the functioning of the platform, please use the SmartDots feedback page at https://smartdots.ices.dk/Userfeedback
The development of SmartDots within ICES is guided by the Working Group on SmartDots Governance (WGSMART) in close cooperation with the Working Group on Biological Parameters (WGBIOP).
The SmartDots software is an open source solution originally developed by ILVO (Flanders Research Institute for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food). ICES developed the SmartDots Web Interface, WebAPI and database. The R- scripts for the reporting module were written at DTU Aqua (National Institute of Aquatic Resources) and further developed under WGSMART.  All source code is publicly accessible and under the terms of a General Public License (https://github.com/ices-eg/SmartDots/blob/master/LICENSE ).
