# 2018_smartdotsReport_template

This template is used to create reports from smartdots events.  The settings for the report are contained in the [config.json](config.json) file.  Currently, the code requires direct access to the smartdots database and so must be run by someone with the appropriate access.  To run the template:

```r
library(icesTAF)
sourceAll()
```
