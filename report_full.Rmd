# Executive summary

# Terms of reference

# Agenda and participant list

The agenda can be found in Annex 1 and the list of participants in Annex 2.


# Introduction

This part should include a background to the species, the workshop/exchange 
and what to expect to read about in the report.


# Methods

This report contains statistical analyses and comparisons of age readings 
in the form of tables and graphical plots.

First, an overview of participating age readers and the samples are presented.

Before each table or plot there is a short explanation of it. This text is 
thought as a help to understand the tables/plot and can just be deleted in 
the final output report. The document can be edited just like any other 
.docx file. New text can be added, additional pictures can be included and 
the tables edited. If some tables which are presently in the annexes need to 
be moved to the body of the report this is also possible. Only the plots 
cannot be changed.

In the first part of analysis are presented the tables and plots from the 
Guus Eltink Excel sheet 'Age Reading Comparisons' **(Eltink, A.T.G.W. 2000)**. 
The order and numbering of tables and plots are the same as in the excel sheet. 
Tables 6.1 - 6.4 from the 'Age Reading Comparisons' sheet are not outputted 
since these are merely used to do calculations for the other tables.


**Pecentage Agreement**

In here will go some text and an equation.


**Co-efficient of Variation (CV)**

The table presents the cv per modal age and reader. The cv's are calculated
as the ratio between the standard deviation (σ) and mean value (μ) per 
reader and modal age:

$$CV = { \frac{ {\sigma}} {\mu} } \cdot {100 \%} $$

To the table is also added the CV of all readers combined per modal age and
a weighted mean of the CV per reader. Finally a rank value is added per 
reader, where the reader with the lowest weighted mean is assigned with 
a rank and so forth (in the situation of ties between two weighted means 
will every tied element be assigned to the lowest rank. This is the procedure
for all ties methods when assigning ranks).


**Average Percentage Error (APE)**

APE was calculated based on the method outlined by Beamish & Fournier (1981).
This method is not independent of fish age and thus provides a better estimate
of precision. As the calculations of both CV and APE pose problems if the mean
age is close to 0, all observations for which modal age was 0 were omitted
from the CV and APE calculations.

The average percentage error is calculated per image as:



$$APE = { \frac{ {100 \%}} {n} \sum_{i=1}^n |\frac{a_i-\bar{a}}{\bar{a}}| } $$
where $a_i$ is the age reading of reader $i$ and ${\bar{a}}$ is the mean
of all readings from 1 to $n$.


**Age error matricx (AEM)**

Age error matrices (AEM) were produced following procedures outlined 
by WKSABCAL (2014) where the matrix shows the proportion of each modal
age mis-aged as other ages. The sum of each row is 1, which equals 100%. 
The age data was analysed twice, the first time all readers were included
and the second time only the “advanced” readers were included. If a reader
is “advanced” then they are considered well trained and they provide ages
for stock assessment or similar purposes.  When the AEM is compiled for
assessment purposes it uses only those readers who provide age data for
the stock assessment in that specific area.


**Otolith Growth Analysis**

SmartDots provides a measure of distance between the annotations made by
the readers and thus provides a measure of growth increment width. 
This data is used to establish growth curves for each fish and for each reader.

## Results 

### All readers

**All samples included** 

Those writing the report put TEXT here describing the results.

<!-- PA, CV and APE text --> 
```{r summary_statistics}
summary_statistics <- 
  c(CV  = cv_tab_all[nrow(cv_tab_all), "all"], 
    PA  = pa_tab_all[nrow(pa_tab_all), "all"],
    APE = ape_tab_all[nrow(ape_tab_all), "all"])
```

The weighted average percentage agreement based on modal ages for all readers 
is `r summary_statistics[2]`, with the weighted average CV of `r summary_statistics[1]` and APE of `r summary_statistics[3]`.

```{r cv_table}

# CV TABLE - All readers ######################################################

# Table caption
set.caption('**Table X:** Coefficient of Variation (CV) table presents the CV
             per modal age and reader, the CV of all readers combined per modal 
             age and a weighted mean of the CV per reader. 
             A rank is also assigned to each reader.')

# Output table
pander(style_table1(cv_tab_all), missing = "-")

```

<!-- PA text -->
The percentage agreement per reader per modal age tells how large part of the 
readings that are equal to the modal age. The weighted mean including at the 
bottom of the table is weighted according to number of age readings. 
A rank is also assigned to each reader.

```{r percentage_agreement}

# PERCENTAGE AGREEMENT TABLE - All readers ####################################

# Table caption

             modal age and reader, the PA of all readers combined per modal

             A rank is also assgned to each reader.')

# Output table
pander(style_table1(pa_tab_all), missing="-")

```

<!-- Relative bias text -->
The relative bias is the difference between the mean age (per modal age per 
reader) and modal age. As for the previous tables, a combined bias for all 
readers and weighted means are calculated and finally a rank is assigned 
to each reader.

```{r rb}

             modal age per reader, the relative bias of all readers combined

           modal age, if the estimated mean age is on the 1:1 equilibrium 
           line (solid line). Relative bias is the age difference between 
           estimated mean age and modal age.'

# Output figure 
plot_bias_all(ad_long_all)
```

<!-- Inter reader bias text -->
For each pair that is being compared, the differences between the readings
per image are found and the frequency of each occurring difference is obtained.
A rank value is calculated for the positive and the negative differences 
(R+ and R- in the Guus Eltink sheet). The value with the smallest rank is then
used to calculate a z-value that determines the level of bias (not clear from
Guus Eltink sheet how the equations are defined..).
